The Medical Insurance Project is designed to streamline and manage the various aspects of health insurance services. It focuses on providing an efficient platform for users to purchase, renew, and manage their insurance policies. The system allows users to register, update their personal and medical details, and choose from a variety of insurance plans based on their needs. It also features a premium calculation module that estimates the cost of coverage based on age, health conditions, and selected plan.

An essential part of the project is the claim processing system, which enables users to submit medical claims and track their status. Administrators can review, approve, or reject claims through a secure interface. Additionally, the system maintains a detailed medical history for each policyholder to support claim verification and future premium adjustments.

The project also emphasizes data security and compliance with healthcare regulations, ensuring that sensitive medical and financial information is protected. Overall, the Medical Insurance Project enhances the efficiency of health insurance services while improving accessibility and transparency for users.
